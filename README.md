About me

I am Roman Litvinov and I work as an advertising engineer at Gomselmash. at school, programming (if you can call it that) was considered extremely interesting for me, I liked to figure out what I did wrong and why it didn't work, but I didn't do programming seriously. You may ask how I got to the point where I would do programming well: everyone has that programmer friend who constantly wants to discuss the code, or tell something new from the world of technology, my friend when he talks about it, his eyes light up and it becomes very contagious that you yourself want to know about it all.
